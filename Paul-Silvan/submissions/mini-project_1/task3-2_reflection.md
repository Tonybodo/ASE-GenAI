# Reflections Mini Project 1

## Task 3

Looking briefly at the plan generated by the LLM, it looks like it is covering all bigger parts of the query. However comparing with the PostgreSQL plan and looking at the query itself, it is clear that nearly all complex details are missing. By visualizing the plans we see that the LLM plan has 6 compartments and they are either hash joins, seq scans or sorts. The CTE explanations by the LLM do not seem to be sufficiently detailed to visualize them using the tool. The plan generated by PostreSQL is way more complex with 33 different steps and having also more concrete operations such as parallel seq scans or nested loops or the unique operation. Obviously, the LLM does not have access to the database, thus it cannot give concrete estimates on sizes of operation results, unlike the PostgreSQL execution plan. Overall, the LLM does not seem to be very suited for this kind of task, and we find it difficult to get more out of the LLM without giving away the solution. Considering all of this, the explanations provided by the LLM are rather basic and therefore not very helpful. In terms of differences with task 1 and 2, here in task 3 the results are not really useful or correct and it's difficult to improve them with only the LLM. Our takeaway for automation here would be to rather avoid using the LLM for query planning tasks and use other more adequate tools for it.

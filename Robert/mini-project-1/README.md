# Task 1 of Miniproject 1

## Running the Database

From the same directory as this README, run the following command:

```bash
nix-shell --run "runBackend"
```

Alternatively, simply run `nix-shell`, which greets you with a shell prompt and
a help description. This tells you `runBackend` will run the database and
initialize it.

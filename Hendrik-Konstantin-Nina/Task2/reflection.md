# Reflection Task 1

## Task 2.1

### Steps
- First tried to use the query from Task 1.1 and modify it to get the correct result.
- We first did not look at the results from task 1.2 as these we solve by another team member.
- This resulted in a very complex query that was not working and hard to understand.
- We then looked at the results from task 1.2 and saw that the concept of the WITH clause was used to break down the query into smaller parts.
- We then used this concept to break down the query from 1.1 into smaller parts and build it up step by step.
- Then we modified the query as described in the task description to get the correct result.
- The only more difficult part was to add the row number to each foreign Like over the creation date.

### Time & Difficulty
- It took overall about 2,5 hours to get the correct query.
- We first tried for about 45 minutes to modify the query from task 1.1, without looking at the results from task 1.2.
- It was very difficult, and it became cleat that even an experienced SQL developer would probably task multiple hours to get the correct query.
- After looking at the results from task 1.2 it was much easier to get the correct query.
- We spent around 1 hour to refactor the query from task 1.1 into smaller parts using the WITH clause.
- After this it took about 45 minutes to get the correct query.

1.3: We head quite a bit of theoretical knowledge stemming from courses such as DBS1, DBS2 or the Build your
own Database seminar but rarely applied any of that. So we knew the basic syntax and operations but had no real
practise. For 1.1 we started with developing a query for finding the total likes and then for the larger part of
determining foreign likes we first wrote the query to find friends, then used this to determine the likes which
were not made by friends and thereby calculated the foreign like count. There we wrote smaller subqueries each time
and validated them using the data. We used a bit more than 3 hours for this as there was a lot of debugging and 
rewriting involved which increased the difficulty.

We wrote the queries in a text editor and then pasted them to the terminal for validation. The terminals response
helped a little in discovering syntax errors.

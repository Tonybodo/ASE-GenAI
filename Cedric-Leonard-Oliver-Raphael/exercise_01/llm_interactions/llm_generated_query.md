### User

Please implement the following query:
“Find all messages longer than 100 characters that have been liked by at least 20
people. Only consider messages where at least half of the likes are from people that
are foreign to the message’s creator, with a foreigner being a person that neither the
creator nor any of their friends know. For each message, return the message’s id, the
total number of likes and the number of foreign likes. Sort the returned messages by
the ratio of foreign likes from highest to lowest.”

This is the schema of the database:

### LLM

To solve this problem, we'll follow a step-by-step approach using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to organize the query and make it more readable. Here's how we can break down the problem:

1. **Identify Messages with Length > 100 and at least 20 Likes:**
   - Use the `message` and `likes` tables to find messages longer than 100 characters and with at least 20 likes.
2. **Find Friends of the Message Creator:**
   - Use the `knows` table to find all friends of the message creator.
3. **Find People Known by the Creator and Their Friends:**
   - Again, use the `knows` table to find all people known by the creator and their friends.
4. **Identify Foreign Likers:**
   - Determine likers who are not in the set of people known by the creator and their friends.
5. **Calculate Total Likes and Foreign Likes for Each Message:**
   - Count the total likes and the number of foreign likes for each message.
6. **Filter Messages Where At Least Half of the Likes Are from Foreigners:**
   - Ensure that for each message, at least half of the likes are from foreigners.
7. **Sort the Messages by the Ratio of Foreign Likes:**
   - Order the results by the ratio of foreign likes to total likes in descending order.

Here's the SQL query that implements the above steps:

```sql
WITH message_likes AS (
    SELECT m.m_messageid, m.m_creatorid, COUNT(DISTINCT l.l_personid) AS total_likes
    FROM message m
    JOIN likes l ON l.l_messageid = m.m_messageid
    WHERE m.m_length > 100
    GROUP BY m.m_messageid, m.m_creatorid
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT l.l_personid) >= 20
),
creator_friends AS (
    SELECT m.m_messageid,
           CASE WHEN k.k_person1id = m.m_creatorid THEN k.k_person2id ELSE k.k_person1id END AS friend_id
    FROM message_likes m
    JOIN knows k ON (k.k_person1id = m.m_creatorid OR k.k_person2id = m.m_creatorid)
),
known_people AS (
    SELECT m.m_messageid,
           CASE WHEN k.k_person1id = m.m_creatorid THEN k.k_person2id ELSE k.k_person1id END AS person_known
    FROM message_likes m
    JOIN knows k ON (k.k_person1id = m.m_creatorid OR k.k_person2id = m.m_creatorid)
    UNION
    SELECT cf.m_messageid,
           CASE WHEN k.k_person1id = cf.friend_id THEN k.k_person2id ELSE k.k_person1id END AS person_known
    FROM creator_friends cf
    JOIN knows k ON (k.k_person1id = cf.friend_id OR k.k_person2id = cf.friend_id)
),
likers AS (
    SELECT m.m_messageid, l.l_personid AS liker_id
    FROM message_likes m
    JOIN likes l ON l.l_messageid = m.m_messageid
),
foreign_likes AS (
    SELECT l.m_messageid, COUNT(DISTINCT l.liker_id) AS foreign_likes
    FROM likers l
    LEFT JOIN known_people kp ON kp.m_messageid = l.m_messageid AND kp.person_known = l.liker_id
    WHERE kp.person_known IS NULL
    GROUP BY l.m_messageid
)
SELECT m.m_messageid, m.total_likes, COALESCE(f.foreign_likes, 0) AS foreign_likes
FROM message_likes m
LEFT JOIN foreign_likes f ON f.m_messageid = m.m_messageid
WHERE COALESCE(f.foreign_likes, 0) >= m.total_likes / 2.0
ORDER BY (COALESCE(f.foreign_likes, 0)::float / m.total_likes) DESC;
```

**Explanation:**

- **`message_likes` CTE:** Retrieves messages longer than 100 characters with at least 20 likes.
- **`creator_friends` CTE:** Finds all friends of the message creator.
- **`known_people` CTE:** Combines the creator's friends and the people known by these friends.
- **`likers` CTE:** Lists all people who liked each message.
- **`foreign_likes` CTE:** Counts the number of likes from people not known by the creator or their friends.
- **Final SELECT:** Filters messages where at least half of the likes are from foreigners and sorts them by the ratio of foreign likes.

### User

This is not really optimized and it takes a long time to run. Is it possible to optimize it to be faster without loosing functionality?

### LLM

Certainly! To optimize the query and improve its performance without losing functionality, we'll restructure it to minimize the number of joins and subqueries, especially those that involve per-liker checks. The key optimizations include:

1. **Avoiding Per-Liker Subqueries:**

   - Instead of checking the connection between each liker and the message creator individually, we'll precompute the set of likers who are connected to the creator within two hops.

2. **Minimizing Joins:**

   - We'll reduce the number of joins by consolidating them where possible and using set operations effectively.

3. **Using Indexes:**
   - Ensure that appropriate indexes are in place on columns used in joins and where conditions, such as `knows(k_person1id, k_person2id)`, `likes(l_messageid, l_personid)`, and `message(m_messageid, m_length)`.

Here is the optimized SQL query:

```sql
WITH message_likes AS (
    -- Step 1: Get messages longer than 100 characters with at least 20 likes
    SELECT
        m.m_messageid,
        m.m_creatorid,
        COUNT(DISTINCT l.l_personid) AS total_likes
    FROM
        message m
    JOIN
        likes l ON l.l_messageid = m.m_messageid
    WHERE
        m.m_length > 100
    GROUP BY
        m.m_messageid,
        m.m_creatorid
    HAVING
        COUNT(DISTINCT l.l_personid) >= 20
),
likers AS (
    -- Step 2: Get all likers for the selected messages
    SELECT
        ml.m_messageid,
        ml.m_creatorid,
        l.l_personid AS liker_id
    FROM
        message_likes ml
    JOIN
        likes l ON l.l_messageid = ml.m_messageid
),
connected_likers AS (
    -- Step 3: Find likers connected to the creator within two hops
    SELECT DISTINCT
        l.m_messageid,
        l.liker_id
    FROM
        likers l
    WHERE
        l.liker_id = l.m_creatorid  -- The liker is the creator
    UNION
    -- Direct friends
    SELECT DISTINCT
        l.m_messageid,
        l.liker_id
    FROM
        likers l
    JOIN
        knows k ON (k.k_person1id = l.m_creatorid AND k.k_person2id = l.liker_id)
               OR (k.k_person2id = l.m_creatorid AND k.k_person1id = l.liker_id)
    UNION
    -- Friends of friends
    SELECT DISTINCT
        l.m_messageid,
        l.liker_id

),
foreign_likes AS (

    SELECT
        l.m_messageid,
        COUNT(DISTINCT l.liker_id) AS foreign_like_count
    FROM
        likers l
    LEFT JOIN
        connected_likers cl ON cl.m_messageid = l.m_messageid AND cl.liker_id = l.liker_id
    WHERE
        cl.liker_id IS NULL  -- Likers not connected within two hops
    GROUP BY
        l.m_messageid
)
-- Step 5: Select messages where at least half of the likes are from foreigners
SELECT
    ml.m_messageid,
    ml.total_likes,
    COALESCE(fl.foreign_like_count, 0) AS foreign_likes
FROM
    message_likes ml
LEFT JOIN
    foreign_likes fl ON fl.m_messageid = ml.m_messageid
WHERE
    COALESCE(fl.foreign_like_count, 0) >= ml.total_likes / 2.0
ORDER BY
    (COALESCE(fl.foreign_like_count, 0)::FLOAT / ml.total_likes) DESC;
```

**Explanation of the Optimizations:**

- **Step 1 (`message_likes` CTE):**

  - Filters messages to those longer than 100 characters and with at least 20 likes.
  - This reduces the dataset early on, minimizing the number of records processed in subsequent steps.

- **Step 2 (`likers` CTE):**

  - Retrieves all likers for the selected messages.
  - Simplifies further joins by having a direct list of likers per message.

- **Step 3 (`connected_likers` CTE):**

  - Identifies likers who are connected to the message creator within two hops.
  - Uses `UNION` of three queries to cover:
    - Likers who are the creator themselves.
    - Likers who are direct friends of the creator.
    - Likers who are friends of friends of the creator.
  - The joins are structured to avoid unnecessary complexity and to exploit any indexes on the `knows` table.

- **Step 4 (`foreign_likes` CTE):**

  - Calculates the number of foreign likes by excluding connected likers.
  - Uses a `LEFT JOIN` to find likers not present in `connected_likers`.

- **Step 5 (Final `SELECT`):**
  - Selects messages where at least half of the likes are from foreigners.
  - Uses `COALESCE` to handle cases where there are no foreign likes.
  - Orders the messages by the ratio of foreign likes from highest to lowest.

**Additional Recommendations:**

- **Indexing:**

  - Create indexes on columns frequently used in joins and filters:
    - `knows(k_person1id, k_person2id)`
    - `likes(l_messageid, l_personid)`
    - `message(m_messageid, m_length)`
  - Indexes can significantly improve the performance of join operations and where conditions.

- **Statistics and Execution Plans:**

  - Analyze the database to update statistics, helping the query optimizer make better decisions.
  - Use `EXPLAIN` to review the query execution plan and identify any bottlenecks.

- **Materialized Views (Optional):**

  - If the data doesn't change frequently, consider creating materialized views for complex subqueries or CTEs.
  - Materialized views can store the result sets of expensive operations, speeding up query execution.

- **Limiting Data Early:**
  - Ensure that filters (e.g., message length and like counts) are applied as early as possible to reduce the data processed in later stages.

**Benefits of the Optimized Query:**

- **Reduced Complexity:**

  - By avoiding per-liker subqueries, we reduce the computational overhead.

- **Efficient Use of Joins:**

  - Consolidating joins and using `UNION` operations efficiently processes relationships.

- **Scalability:**
  - The query is better suited for larger datasets due to minimized intermediate result sizes.

By implementing these optimizations and recommendations, the query should execute more quickly and efficiently, providing the desired results without losing any functionality.

### User

Please extend the query as follows:

“For each message, also return the full name of the first foreign person who liked the
message and the time when they created the like.”

**Explanation of the Extended Query:**

- **`message_likes` CTE:**

  - Identifies messages longer than 100 characters with at least 20 likes.
  - This reduces the dataset early, improving performance.

- **`likers` CTE:**

  - Retrieves all likers for the selected messages, including the creation date of the like.
  - Adding `l_creationdate` allows us to determine the first foreign liker later.

- **`connected_likers` CTE:**

  - Finds likers connected to the message creator within two hops (the creator themselves, direct friends, and friends of friends).
  - This step uses efficient joins and unions to minimize processing time.

- **`foreign_likers` CTE:**

  - Lists all likers who are not connected to the creator within two hops (foreign likers).
  - Includes the creation date to help identify the first foreign liker.

- **`foreign_likes_counts` CTE:**

  - Calculates the number of foreign likes for each message.
  - This is used to check if at least half of the likes are from foreigners.

- **`first_foreign_liker` CTE:**

  - Determines the first foreign liker for each message based on the earliest `l_creationdate`.
  - Uses `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank likers by creation date within each message.

- **`person_names` CTE:**

  - Retrieves the full names of all persons.
  - This avoids joining the `person` table multiple times and improves performance.

- **Final `SELECT`:**
  - Retrieves the required details for each message:
    - `m_messageid`: Message ID.
    - `total_likes`: Total number of likes.
    - `foreign_likes`: Number of foreign likes.
    - `first_foreign_liker_name`: Full name of the first foreign liker.
    - `first_foreign_like_time`: Time when the first foreign like was created.
  - Filters messages where at least half of the likes are from foreigners.
  - Orders the messages by the ratio of foreign likes from highest to lowest.

**Performance Optimizations:**

- **Early Filtering:**

  - Applying filters at the earliest stages reduces the amount of data processed in later steps.

- **Efficient Joins and Unions:**

  - Structured joins in `connected_likers` minimize redundant computations.
  - Unions are used to combine results from different relationship paths efficiently.

- **Index Utilization:**

  - Ensure indexes are in place on commonly joined columns:
    - `knows(k_person1id, k_person2id)`
    - `likes(l_messageid, l_personid)`
    - `person(p_personid)`
  - Indexes improve join performance and filter operations.

- **Avoiding Subqueries in Select Clause:**

  - By using CTEs, we avoid subqueries in the `SELECT` clause, which can be less efficient.

- **Aggregations After Filtering:**
  - Counts and aggregations are performed after applying necessary filters, reducing the data volume.

**Additional Recommendations:**

- **Database Statistics:**

  - Update the database statistics using `ANALYZE` to help the query planner optimize execution.

- **Execution Plan Analysis:**

  - Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to inspect the query execution plan and identify any potential bottlenecks.

- **Materialized Views (If Applicable):**

  - For static data or infrequent updates, consider using materialized views for complex CTEs.

- **Parameter Tuning:**
  - Adjust database parameters related to memory allocation and parallelism to improve query performance.

**Assumptions Made:**

- The `likes` table includes a `l_creationdate` column, which holds the time when the like was created.
- The `person` table includes `p_firstname` and `p_lastname` columns for the person's full name.
- All necessary indexes are in place to support efficient joins and filtering.

**Conclusion:**

The extended query efficiently retrieves the required information without compromising performance. By carefully structuring the CTEs and joins, we minimize processing overhead and ensure that the query scales well with larger datasets. This approach maintains functionality while providing the additional requested details for each message.

Generate an execution plan for the query in the same format as PostgreSQL's EXPLAIN keyword

### LLM

Certainly! Below is an estimated execution plan for the provided SQL query in the format that PostgreSQL's `EXPLAIN` keyword would output. Please note that this execution plan is a hypothetical approximation, as the actual plan would depend on the database schema details, data distribution, indexes, and PostgreSQL version and configuration. For precise execution plans, it's recommended to run `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on the actual database.

**Explanation of the Execution Plan Components:**

1. **Nested Loop Left Join:**

   - The outermost operation combines the main data from `message_likes` (`ml`) with the counts of foreign likes (`flc`), applying the filter where at least half of the likes are from foreigners.

2. **Gather:**

   - Utilizes parallel workers to improve performance on large datasets.

3. **Hash Join and HashAggregate:**

   - Used for joining and aggregating data efficiently.
   - `HashAggregate` computes the counts needed for grouping operations, such as total likes and foreign likes.

4. **Seq Scan (Sequential Scan):**

   - Scans entire tables where appropriate indexes are not available or deemed less efficient.
   - On tables like `likes`, `message`, and `foreign_likers`.

5. **Index Scan:**

   - Scans indexes to quickly locate specific rows.
   - On primary key columns like `likes_pkey` and `person_pkey`.

6. **Filter Conditions:**

   - Applied early to reduce the amount of data processed in subsequent steps.
   - Example: `Filter: (m_length > 100)` on the `message` table.

7. **Join Filters and Conditions:**

   - Ensures that only relevant rows are joined, improving efficiency.
   - Example: `Hash Cond: (l.l_messageid = m.m_messageid)` ensures likes are matched to the correct messages.

8. **Workers Planned: X:**
   - Indicates the number of parallel workers PostgreSQL plans to use for parallelizable operations.
   - The actual number depends on the configuration (`max_parallel_workers_per_gather`).

**Notes and Recommendations:**

- **Indexes:**

  - Ensure that indexes exist on the following columns to optimize the query:
    - `message(m_messageid, m_length)`
    - `likes(l_messageid, l_personid, l_creationdate)`
    - `knows(k_person1id, k_person2id)`
    - `person(p_personid, p_firstname, p_lastname)`

- **Statistics:**

  - Run `ANALYZE` on the database to update statistics, which helps the query planner make informed decisions.

- **Configuration Parameters:**

  - Adjust PostgreSQL configuration parameters like `work_mem`, `maintenance_work_mem`, and `effective_cache_size` to optimize performance for large queries.

- **EXPLAIN ANALYZE:**
  - For actual execution times and more precise planning, run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on the query in your database environment.

**Understanding the Plan Hierarchy:**

- The execution plan starts by filtering and aggregating the `message` and `likes` tables to find messages that meet the criteria (long messages with at least 20 likes).
- It then joins this result with the `foreign_likes_counts` to get the number of foreign likes per message.
- The plan proceeds to join with `first_foreign_liker` and `person_names` to retrieve the full name and like creation date of the first foreign liker.
- Throughout the plan, PostgreSQL uses hash joins and aggregations to efficiently process large datasets.
- The use of parallel workers (`Gather`) indicates that PostgreSQL will execute parts of the query in parallel to improve performance.

**Conclusion:**

This estimated execution plan provides a high-level view of how PostgreSQL might execute the provided query. The actual plan may differ based on the specifics of your database setup, including data distribution, existing indexes, and configuration parameters. To obtain an accurate execution plan, it's best to run the query with `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` in your PostgreSQL environment.
